                        <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
                            Mississippi
                            River in what is now
                            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                            celebrated it as part of an
                            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New
                            Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                            account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                            (including cross-dressing).
                            An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions
                            and
                            wearing of masks in the
                            streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                            renewed whenever such
                            restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                            In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent
                            raised money to fund an
                            official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                            Miscellaneous Pieces
                            describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835</p><br>
                        <p>Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for
                            fun, frolic, and comic
                            masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation.
                            Men
                            and boys, women and
                            girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and
                            appear
                            in grotesque, quizzical,
                            diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts
                            and
                            birds, beasts and birds
                            with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes;
                            man-bats
                            from the moon;
                            mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in
                            wagons,
                            carts, coaches, cars,
                            &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing,
                            drumming,
                            fiddling, fifeing, and
                            all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.</p><br>
                        <p>In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret
                            society to observe Mardi Gras
                            with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of
                            Comus. According to one
                            historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always
                            considered a French
                            festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the
                            holiday had passed from
                            French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New
                            Orleans and its Creoles. To a
                            certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans
                            boasting of how their business
                            prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in
                            organized Carnival passed from
                            Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the
                            nineteenth
                            century. The spectacle of
                            Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the
                            ballrooms and on the
                            streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor
                            entirely
                            American."</p><br>
                        <p>In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and
                            weather conditions
                            sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                            Civil
                            War, World War I and
                            World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.</p><br>
                        <p>The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American
                            Mutoscope
                            Co. The rumored but
                            long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats,
                            including one transporting a
                            live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or
                            aesthetically
                            significant" by the
                            National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.</p>
